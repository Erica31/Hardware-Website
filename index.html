	<h1>Erica Lee</h1>

	<p>Something interesting about me is I am heavily involved in rhythmic gymnastics and just earned the provincial champion title in my category this year! Some hobbies I recently picked up painting and embroidery, I find it relaxing during my free time but finished products don't look good yet. I'm currently fairly into Animal Crossing: New Horizons and recently hit the 1 year milestone of playing since quarantine.</p>
